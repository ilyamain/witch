Witch. Blockchain CMS

This project is now under revision. It will be rewritten in C ++. At least the part that is responsible for mining.

And the most important difference from what is now - the project will be made using DAG technology. This will increase the speed of transactions on it.

Since the ultimate goal - the creation of a decentralized exchange of goods, the speed of the application will greatly affect the opportunities provided by this project.
